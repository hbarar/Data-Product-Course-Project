This app gives you the idea regardingthe amount of salary that professors recieve  corresponding to their years of experience . The data was downloaded from the website [faq]: https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html .

STEPS :

First, you need to select the gender as well as the rank of the professor . Then specify the range of years of experience and how long it passed since getting PhD.
